# has a known problem of hanging tabs. The workaround
#for this problem is to mount ~/.cache/chromium as memory-fs.
#In order to do this, before you run chromium, please run these
#commands once as root for each user who uses chromium (replace
#{user}/{group} with your user/group names):

# [ -d ~{user}/.cache/chromium ] || mkdir ~{user}/.cache/chromium
# echo "md $(echo ~{user})/.cache/chromium mfs rw,late,-w{user}:{group},-s300m 2 0" >> /etc/fstab
# mount ~{user}/.cache/chromium
 [ -d ~/.cache/chromium ] || mkdir ~/.cache/chromium
echo "md $(echo ~)/.cache/chromium mfs rw,late,-wroot:wheel,-s300m 2 0" >> /etc/fstab
 mount ~/.cache/chromium
